# Visual QA & Dilution Prevention Checklist

## Purpose
Prevent brand dilution, over-design, and marketing creep.

## Before Approving Any Screen
- Does this add clarity or just decoration?
- Can this be slower or quieter?
- Can this be removed entirely?
- Does imagery lead before text?

## Motion Checks
- No motion under 300ms
- No bounce, spring, or elastic easing
- One animation per screen maximum

## Visual Discipline
- No new colors outside tokens
- No new components without system approval
- No icons explaining obvious things

## Mobile Check
- One-thumb usable
- Readable while walking
- No hover-dependent meaning

If any answer fails → revise.
